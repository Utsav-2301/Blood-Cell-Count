# Blood-Cell-Count
I read research papers on cell counting, then created a project using image processing and deep learning. By utilizing the cbc dataset of stained blood cell images (RBCs, WBCs, and Platelets), I employed darkflow net and yolo algorithms. The result: an impressive 94.6% accuracy in detecting and counting cells.
